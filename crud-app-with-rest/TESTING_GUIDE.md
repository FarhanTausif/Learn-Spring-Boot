---

### 2. Students Management Page (`/students`)
**URL**: http://localhost:8080/students

#### ✅ CRUD Operations to Test:
- [ ] **View Students**: Both card and table views
- [ ] **Add Student**: Use modal form with validation
- [ ] **Edit Student**: Click edit button, modify data
- [ ] **Delete Student**: Confirm deletion works
- [ ] **View Details**: Click view button for student details

#### 🧪 Advanced Features to Test:
1. **Search**: Type in search box - real-time filtering
2. **Age Filters**: Use dropdown filters (16-20, 21-25, etc.)
3. **Course Status Filter**: Filter by with/without courses
4. **View Mode Toggle**: Switch between cards and table view
5. **Statistics Updates**: Watch cards update after operations

#### 📝 Form Validation to Test:
- Try submitting empty forms
- Enter invalid email formats
- Test age limits (16-100)
- Check duplicate email handling

---

### 3. Courses Management Page (`/courses`)
**URL**: http://localhost:8080/courses

#### ✅ CRUD Operations to Test:
- [ ] **View Courses**: Both card and table views
- [ ] **Add Course**: With/without student assignment
- [ ] **Edit Course**: Modify title, credits, assignment
- [ ] **Delete Course**: Confirm deletion
- [ ] **View Details**: Check course and student info

#### 🧪 Assignment Features to Test:
1. **Student Assignment**: Assign courses to students
2. **Assignment Status**: Filter by assigned/unassigned
3. **Credits Filter**: Filter by credit ranges
4. **Visual Indicators**: Green border for assigned, yellow for unassigned
5. **Student Info Display**: Should show assigned student details

---

### 4. JPQL Demo Page (`/jpql-demo`)
**URL**: http://localhost:8080/jpql-demo

#### ✅ Query Demonstrations to Test:
- [ ] **Basic Queries**: Find by email, find by title
- [ ] **Advanced Queries**: Age ranges, credit ranges
- [ ] **Pattern Matching**: Search functionality
- [ ] **Statistics**: Count operations, existence checks
- [ ] **Top Results**: Top students, top courses
- [ ] **Special Operations**: Null checks, DTOs, relationships

#### 🧪 Interactive Features to Test:
1. **Run Complete Demo**: Click the main demo button
2. **Individual Queries**: Test each section separately
3. **Query Timing**: Check performance metrics displayed
4. **Result Display**: Verify data shows in tables/lists
5. **Clear Results**: Test the clear button

## 🔧 API Endpoints to Test

### Student Endpoints:
```bash
# Get all students
curl http://localhost:8080/api/students

# Get student summaries (DTO)
curl http://localhost:8080/api/students/summary

# Search students
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/students/search?query=john"

# Get students by age range
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/students/age-range?minAge=20&maxAge=30"
```

### Course Endpoints:
```bash
# Get all courses with DTOs
curl http://localhost:8080/api/courses/dto

# Get unassigned courses
curl http://localhost:8080/api/courses/unassigned

# Search courses
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/courses/search?title=math"
```

### JPQL Demo Endpoints:
```bash
# Complete demo data
curl http://localhost:8080/api/jpql-demo/demo

# Find by email
curl http://localhost:8080/api/students/find-by-email/test@example.com

# Count with courses
curl http://localhost:8080/api/students/count-with-courses
```

## 🎯 Expected Behaviors

### 1. **Dynamic Loading**
- Pages should show loading spinners during API calls
- Data should update without page refresh
- Error messages should appear for failed operations

### 2. **Responsive Design**
- Test on different screen sizes
- Mobile menu should work properly
- Cards should stack on smaller screens

### 3. **Real-time Features**
- Search should filter results as you type
- Statistics should update after CRUD operations
- Toast notifications should appear for actions

### 4. **Form Validation**
- Client-side validation should work immediately
- Server-side validation should return proper errors
- Success messages should appear after successful operations

---

## 🐛 Common Issues to Check

### If something doesn't work:

1. **Check Console**: Open browser dev tools (F12) for JavaScript errors
2. **Network Tab**: Verify API calls are working
3. **Database**: Ensure PostgreSQL is running
4. **Port**: Confirm application is on port 8080

### Browser Testing:
- **Chrome**: Should work perfectly
- **Firefox**: Should work perfectly
- **Safari**: Should work with minor differences
- **Mobile**: Test responsive features

---

## 💡 Testing Tips

1. **Start Fresh**: Clear browser cache if issues occur
2. **Use Dev Tools**: F12 to monitor network requests and console
3. **Test Incrementally**: Test one feature at a time
4. **Add Sample Data**: Create a few students and courses first
5. **Check Logs**: Monitor Spring Boot console for errors

---

## 🎉 Success Criteria

Your Thymeleaf integration is working correctly if:

✅ All pages load without errors
✅ JavaScript interactions work smoothly
✅ CRUD operations complete successfully
✅ Real-time features update dynamically
✅ Responsive design works on mobile
✅ Toast notifications appear appropriately
✅ Statistics update after operations
✅ JPQL demos execute and display results

## 📞 Next Steps

After testing, you can:
1. Add more sample data for better testing
2. Customize the styling further
3. Add additional features
4. Deploy to production
5. Show your mentor the impressive results!

This integration demonstrates all the concepts your mentor requested:
- ✅ Lombok usage
- ✅ No @OneToMany annotations
- ✅ Derived query methods (JPQL power)
- ✅ Optional<> usage
- ✅ DTOs for subset attributes
